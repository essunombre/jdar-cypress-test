So after I have my project, I want to run, npm install cypress --save-dev --force
this will install cypress on my package json.
Now is time to run cypress for the first time to open Cypress configutator, npx cypress open

I will have 2 options:
-Component testing, when I want to test specific Ui components on a web application.
-E2E testing the one I am looking for. I select this one and leave it as default.

Then I will see somthing like Scaffold examples of different test

NOW I SHOULD SEE A CYPRESS FOLDER.

By default it has TS right now, I can change the tests to be js, by going to the cypressconfig.ts.
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration

FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE - cypress (folders)

support:
-E2E: First thing that gets executed when a test is run so it is a good place to setup my environment.
-command: I can create my own custom commands, good practice is to use commands that can be used on the entire framework. 
for example login command.

fixtures:
I can keep my JSON files, it can hold my test data hold the response of mock api

E2E:
the place where tests are stored, the getting started is there and the advanced examples. Here I will be adding my folder with pro tests brother.

/.cypress.config.js

to start configuring I can read guides/references/configuration. Testing Type-Specific Options e2e
I will use as well the excludeSpecPattern.
